  The Slice Logic Distribution report is not meaningful if the design is
  over-mapped for a non-slice resource or if Placement fails.

  Number of DCMs:                         1 out of       2   50%

Average Fanout of Non-Clock Nets:                4.19

Peak Memory Usage:  4434 MB
Total REAL time to MAP completion:  1 secs 
Total CPU time to MAP completion:   1 secs 

NOTES:

   Related logic is defined as being logic that shares connectivity - e.g. two
   LUTs are "related" if they share common inputs.  When assembling slices,
   Map gives priority to combine logic that is related.  Doing so results in
   the best timing performance.

   Unrelated logic shares no connectivity.  Map will only begin packing
   unrelated logic into a slice once 99% of the slices are occupied through
   related logic packing.

   Note that once logic distribution reaches the 99% level through related
   logic packing, this does not mean the device is completely utilized.
   Unrelated logic packing will then begin, continuing until all usable LUTs
   and FFs are occupied.  Depending on your timing budget, increased levels of
   unrelated logic packing may adversely affect the overall timing performance
   of your design.

Section 2 - Warnings
--------------------
WARNING:PhysDesignRules:367 - The signal <pulse_IBUF> is incomplete. The signal
   does not drive any load pins in the design.

Section 3 - Informational
-------------------------
INFO:Map:110 - output buffer 'sdin_OBUF' driving design level port 'sdin' is
   being pushed into module 'u1_Zsy_OLEDModule/inst_ZsySPI_TxByte' to enable I/O
   register usage. The buffer has been renamed as
   'u1_Zsy_OLEDModule/inst_ZsySPI_TxByte/sdin_OBUF'.
INFO:LIT:243 - Logical network pulse_IBUF has no load.
INFO:MapLib:562 - No environment variables are currently set.
INFO:PhysDesignRules:772 - To achieve optimal frequency synthesis performance
   with the CLKFX and CLKFX180 outputs of the DCM comp inst_ZsyDCM/DCM_SP_INST,
   consult the device Interactive Data Sheet.
