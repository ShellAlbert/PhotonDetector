    Number used exclusively as route-thrus:    136
      Number with same-slice register load:     27
      Number with same-slice carry load:       109
      Number with other load:                    0

Slice Logic Distribution:
  Number of occupied Slices:                 2,003 out of   3,758   53%
  Number of MUXCYs used:                     2,308 out of   7,516   30%
  Number of LUT Flip Flop pairs used:        6,245
    Number with an unused Flip Flop:         4,373 out of   6,245   70%

    Number of slice register sites lost
      to control set restrictions:             579 out of  30,064    1%

  A LUT Flip Flop pair for this architecture represents one LUT paired with
  one Flip Flop within a slice.  A control set is a unique combination of
  clock, reset, set, and enable signals for a registered element.
  The Slice Logic Distribution report is not meaningful if the design is
  over-mapped for a non-slice resource or if Placement fails.
